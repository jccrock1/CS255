## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client is a company named DriverPass. They are aiming to create a site for assisting people in their upcoming driving exams and final driving test. They are wanting to design a system for customers to access various content from scheduling in-person training and lessons with instructors, to utilzing self-study tools from the official DMV documents. Their system will manage all of this and provide employees and admins with varying special functions and ways to assist customers.

## What did you do particularly well?

I think that my charting was well organized and good, particularly my activity diagrams. I made sure to distill the requirements effeciently and focused on the organization/neatness of the design.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Particularly, I would want to reorganize some of the UML Class diagram. I believe I included the right information, but I would really like to make the chart more organized and detailed. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It really helped to read through the interview transcrip first. I think this class was set up in such a way to help us succeed if we did the work properly throughout. Transfering the interview information to aGnatt chart and making a list of requirments needed to be finished (and in order) was a great visualization of the external requirments needed for the website. Breaking down each section to basic tasks, as well as giving roles to each person(s) involved (customer, employee, admin, etc.) really assisted me in visualizing the charts and how each task would be implemented within the project/site. Taking the user's needs into account when designing will save you much, MUCH time when assigning roles and building the site in general.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I still consider myself a newbie when it comes to designing software. I recognize that it's important to read through/understand all requirements involved first in creating a checklist of essentials before any building is done. It's also important to break down all of those requirements into classes (and objects within) to isolate their actions, and to then puzzle them together to see how the objects interact with one another. Creating diagrams for these instances is where much of what we did in this class comes in, and is so important! Once those charts and diagrams are built, is when one can start coding. It makes me recognize that I shouldn't just jump straight in to the coding process without first better understanding (both visually and conceptually) what it is that I'm creating/developing!
